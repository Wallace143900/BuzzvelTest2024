# Buzzvel 2024 - Ready to 2025: Dev Team Test

This repository contains the implementation of a responsive landing page developed with **Next.js**, based on the design provided by Buzzvel in **Figma**. The project was created with a focus on interactivity, responsiveness, and performance optimization, meeting the criteria required for the front-end developer position.

## üìù About the Test

- **Application Period**: October 15-22, 2024
- **Code Review**: October 23-30, 2024
- **Interviews**: November 1-13, 2024
- **Final Decision**: November 26, 2024

**Instructions**:
- I converted the **Figma** design into fully functional web and mobile pages.
- Main technologies used: **Next.js** for server-side rendering (SSR) and **React**.
- The final design is fully responsive and optimized for performance and SEO.

## üéØ Project Goal

To implement an interface that strictly adheres to the provided design, with animations and optimization for SEO and performance.

## üöÄ Technologies and Tools

- **Next.js**: Framework used for SSR and SEO optimization.
- **React**: Library for building a Single Page Application (SPA) and component reuse.
- **TypeScript**: Enhances code safety.
- **CSS3 and Sass**: Styling and animation creation.
- **Animations**: CSS3 animations and Framer Motion for a smoother user experience.

## üìê Prototyping and Design

The implementation closely followed the Figma design for both prototypes (web and mobile):

## üåü Implemented Features

- **Total Responsiveness**: The layout automatically adapts to mobile devices, tablets, and desktops.
- **Interactivity**: Various interactive elements that enhance the browsing experience.
- **SEO and Performance**: SEO techniques applied, such as meta tags and semantic HTML, with lazy loading to improve performance.
- **Animations**: CSS3 animations were implemented. Effort was made to animate the cards in the **'Make Something'** section, but due to time constraints, the card animation was not completed. The modal animation at the 768px resolution was successfully finished.
